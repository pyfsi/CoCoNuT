1) Case: tube_openfoam3d_abaqus3d
-------------------------------
source setup.openfoam.sh
python run_simulation.py project_parameters_mapped.json

2) In case of coconut can't be found... go to
--------------------------------

vi ~/.bashrc

-check export python path should be: export PYTHONPATH=/cfdfile2/data/fm/mathieu/PycharmProjects/coconut/:$PYTHONPATH

3) Serial_IDs
-------------------------------
Go into ./constant/polyMesh/boundary

in this case check the "mantle" part

startFace nr: 17792 
nFaces: 1536 ( to have endFace=> 17792+1536)

If you go into ./constant/polyMesh/faces

numbers in boundary represents the chronological order where the faces are situated.
The 4 numbers that are given at each face, represents the way how each face is meshed. The 4 represents blocks. The 4 numbers represents the place where te coordinates are situated. These coordinates can be found in ./constant/polyMesh/points
