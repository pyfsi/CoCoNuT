# Examples

This documentation describes the different example cases.
Currently all these examples calculate the flow in a flexible tube.

## Folder and file structure

This section describes the different folders and files that are provided.

-   `run_simulation.py`: main file, has to be run with the parameter file as argument
-   `parameters.json`: parameter file in JSON format
-   `setup_X`: setup folder containing all files for setting up solver X
-   `setup_X.sh`: bash script, has to be run to set up solver X
-   `X.md`: description of the specific example

When the setup files are run, working directories are created that have to match the ones specified in the parameter file.
These folder are expandable and are deleted when the setup files are (re)run.

## Project Parameters

The parameter file `parameters.json` can be interpreted as a dictionary. 
There are two main keys.
The first is `settings` in which the number of time steps for which the calculation is run is specified.
The second is `coupled_solver` in which all parameters related to solver algorithm are given: coupling algorithm, predictor, convergence criteria and solvers.

## Running a case

In order to run an example case, first, the setup files have to be run to create the working directories.
Then, the calculation is started by running `run_simulation.py` with the parameter file as argument.
Note that for Abaqus, the setup file must be *sourced*. 

For example, for a case with Fluent and Abaqus, you would run the following commands:

    ./setup_fluent
    source setup_abaqus.sh
    python run_simulation.py project_parameters_X.json
    
## Debug files

The folder `examples` also contains a folder `debug_files` containing scripts for debug purposes.
These files might need some adjustements to work. 
In order to use them, the debug boolean `self.debug` has to be `True` in the code of the corresponding solver wrappers.
