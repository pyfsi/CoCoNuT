# Lid-driven cavity case with Fluent2D and KratosStructure2D

This case is an FSI-adaptation of the famous lid-driven cavity case, calculated using Fluent and KratosMultiphysics StructuralMechanicsApplication.
Here, the bottom wall is deformable and an oscillatory velocity is applied at the top.

![geometry](images/lid_driven_cavity_geometry.svg "Geometry and boundary conditions of the lid-driven cavity case")

The oscillatory x-component of the velocity is applied not only at the top, but also in a region at the upper left side wall.
As shown in the figure above, the velocity increases linearly with the height. The y-component of the velocity is zero.
The oscillating velocity $\bar{v}$ is given by
$$
\bar{v}=1-\cos\left(\frac{2\pi t}{5}\right),
$$
with t the time.
On the corresponding region on the right side, zero pressure is applied.
The deformable bottom is fixed at the corners.

The fluid parameters are:

-   density: 1 kg/m³
-   dynamic viscosity: 0.01 Pa$\cdot$s

The deformable bottom is fixed at its left and right side and consists of a linear elastic material with the follwing properties:

-   density: 500 kg/m³
-   modulus of elasticity: 250 Pa
-   poisson's ratio: 0.0

The total simulated time is 70 s in time steps of 0.1 s.

Reference solutions are available from Mok [[1](#1)] and Valdes [[2](#2)].
The figure belows shows a comparison with the solution of the examples with Fluent and OpenFOAM.

The following figures show contour plots of the pressure and velocity for this example (with Fluent).

A script _`evaluate_benchmark.py`_ is provided to compare the results with the benchmark results in [[1](#1)] and lid_driven_cavity_.
Furthermore, the script _`animate_lid_driven_cavity.py`_ can be used to visualize the interface data throughout the calculation.

## Coupling algorithm

The coupling technique used is the *interface quasi-Newton algorithm with an approximation for the inverse of the Jacobian from a least-squares model* (IQNI-LS).
No reuse is employed, so the reuse parameter `q` is set to 0.

## Predictor

The initial guess in every time step is done using the linear predictor.

## Convergence criterion

Two convergence criteria have been specified:

-   The number of iterations in every time step is larger than 15.
-   The residual norm of the displacement is smaller than $10^{-9}$.

When either criterion is satisfied the simulation stops.

## Solvers

Fluent is used as flow solver.
A quadrilateral mesh is used with 32 cells on each side of the cavity.
A script to regenerate it using Gambit is included. This script allows to change the resolution and geometrical parameters.
Dynamic mesh motion is achieved using a spring method.

The structure solver is KratosMultiphysics StructuralMechanicsApplication (abbreviated KratosStructure).
The deformable bottom is meshed with 2 layers of 32 _TotalLagrangianElement2D4N_ elements.
The movement of the left and right side is constrained.

To exchange information between the solvers on the fluid-structure interface, the use of mappers is required.
In the structure solver wrapper, a linear interpolation mapper is used to interpolate in the x-direction from and to the coupled solver.
