README file for wire drawing case:

To install CoCoNuT, instructions can be found on: https://github.com/pyfsi/coconut/tree/wire_drawing
The  "wire_drawing" branch is used for this simulation, with corresponding modified solver wrappers and mappers.
The wrappers are made for OpenFOAM 8 and foam-extend 4.1 and modified to let it run a wire drawing case with sliding interface and no-slip
condition at the FSI interface.

The structural solver is developped by Philip Cardiff and adapt to achieve FSI calculations for this wire drawing case with black box approach.
Please read carefully the README file for installing the structural solver(https://github.com/pyfsi/coconut/tree/wire_drawing/coupling_components/
solver_wrappers/openfoam_extend/v41/source_code_structure_wire_drawing). The structural calculation makes use of a layering technique in order
to reduce the computational cost. Unfortunally, this code can't be shared as this is developped in-house the company where the strucutural solver is applied,
to have a deeper understanding of the metal forming process of dry wire drawing.

The parameter.json file includes the settings of the FSI case
The setup_openfoam and setup_foamExtend directories contain the initial case for the fluid as the structural calculations respectively. 
To start the simulation. Go to the directory case of "wire_drawing" (https://github.com/pyfsi/coconut/tree/wire_drawing/examples/wire_drawing)

execute following commands:

"./Allrun"

For this case, the debug switches of the fluid and structure solver are set on"false" to save space, meaning that only results are saved at
every 10th time steps.

After the simulation has been ran, select which time step you want to obtain the results in the parameter.json-file and execute the command:

"python postProcess.py"

Different graphs with the distribution of different parameters will appear at steady state. 

The results can also been seen at paraFoam.
