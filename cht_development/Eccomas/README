The parameter studies present in the ECCOMAS directory changes variables in the cht_fluent solver wrapper that are normally non-changable outside the file.
As a result, the parameter study will not work right outside the box, but requires some changes to the code in the Coconut coupling components.
The coconut version used for the parameter studies in the ECCOMAS paper is available in the corresponding final folder in the home directory of user victor.
