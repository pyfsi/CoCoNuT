README file for wire drawing case:
The parameter.json file includes teh settings of the FSI case
The setup_openfoam and setup_foamExtend directories contain the initial case for the fluid as the structural calculations respectively. 
To start the simulation. Go to the directory case of "wire_drawing"

execute following commands:
./Allrun

After the simulation has been ran, executing the post processing of the results, execute the command:
python postProcess.py
Different graphs with the distribution of different parameters will appear at steady state. 

The results can also been seen at paraFoam.
